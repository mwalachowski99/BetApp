# Development Process of a Betting Application

## Project Description
The project focuses on creating a simplified version of a betting application, enabling users to place bets on sports event outcomes. The primary emphasis was placed on analyzing the software development process, including comparisons of various technologies and the implementation of key features.

The application, while functional, is primarily for educational purposes and requires further development to be used commercially.

## Key Features
- **Data Acquisition**:
  - Implementation of Web Scraping using Selenium and Beautiful Soup libraries.
  - Legal data extraction of match results and statistics from selected sources.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - Development of an algorithm for calculating odds based on acquired data.
  - Utilization of historical data and statistics to predict outcomes.
- **Database**:
  - Analysis and implementation of database technologies (SQL vs NoSQL).
  - Database schema design and integration with the mobile application.
- **Mobile Application**:
  - Prototype implementation using Android Studio.
  - Authentication functions and user views.

## Project Goals
1. Analyze the process of creating a betting application, including technology selection at each stage.
2. Implement a machine learning-based algorithm to calculate odds for sports events.
3. Develop a mobile application as a visualization of the system's functionality.

## Assumptions
- The project is academic in nature and not a complete implementation of a commercial betting application.
- Key technologies used in the project:
  - Python (for Web Scraping, data analysis, and machine learning).
  - Libraries: Selenium, Beautiful Soup, Pandas, Statsmodels.
  - Android Studio for mobile application development.
  - Database systems: SQL and NoSQL (for analysis and implementation).

## Keywords
Python, Mobile Application, Machine Learning, Sports Betting, Web Scraping

## Notes
The project requires further development in terms of functionality and optimization to be used in real-world business scenarios.
